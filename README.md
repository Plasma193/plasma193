### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
# I'm Luke Pasma
I'm a Software Developer / Software Development Manager located in the Detroit Metro area of Michigan. Currently trying to justify calling myself a Senior Software Engineer by practicing React and Node.js as much as possible. I've got 9+ years of experience in the Software world, but the recent half of that has been as a Manager.
